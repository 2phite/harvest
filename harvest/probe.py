"""Public pre-flight: cheap metadata probe ahead of the full pipeline.

Atlas calls `probe()` to estimate workload (title/duration/parts/per-part durations) before
committing to the full harvest run. Maps `fetch_view`'s `ViewData` onto the stable
`ProbeResult` schema (SPEC: downstream-facing contract, schema.py).

bilibili.tv is deferred (no player-API view endpoint wired yet) - guarded out before any HTTP.
